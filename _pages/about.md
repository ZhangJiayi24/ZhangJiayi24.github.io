## 👨‍🎓 Gabriel Jiayi Zhang / 张珈译

I am an undergraduate student in **Mathematics and Applied Mathematics** at the **University of Nottingham Ningbo China (UNNC)**. My research interests lie in:

- **Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs)**
- **Multimodal Large Language Models (MM-LLMs)**
- **Federated Learning**
- **AI for Science**

I am currently leading the development of a **federated spectral-aware spatio-graph forecasting framework** with **fairness-aware aggregation mechanisms**, targeting submission to **AAAI 2025**. I am also a co-author of multiple peer-reviewed papers currently under review or accepted at international journals and conferences.
