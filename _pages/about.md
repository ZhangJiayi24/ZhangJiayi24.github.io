Short Bio
======

üë®‚Äçüéì Gabriel Jiayi Zhang / Âº†ÁèàËØë

I am an 1st year undergraduate student in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics at the **University of Nottingham Ningbo China (UNNC)**. My research interests lie in:

- **Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs)**
- **Multimodal Large Language Models (MM-LLMs)**
- **AI for Science**

I am currently leading the development of a **federated spectral-aware spatio-graph forecasting framework** with **fairness-aware aggregation mechanisms**, targeting submission to **AAAI 2025**. I am also a co-author of multiple peer-reviewed papers currently under review or accepted at international journals and conferences.

## üéµ Personal Interests 

Outside of research, I enjoy long-distance running, photography, and music composition. I am passionate about interdisciplinary learning, especially at the intersection of math, science, and technology. More than anything, I enjoy reading fiction of all kinds (regardless of length).
